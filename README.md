# Prerequisites
1. You need a copy of Apple's Root Certificate included in your application bundle for local receipt validation to succeed. I wrote "[Receipt Validation ‚Äì Verifying a Receipt Signature in Swift](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2017/07/16/receipt-validation-verifying-a-receipt-signature-in-swift/)" to guide you through this process if you need help.
2. You need OpenSSL to be statically-linked to your project. I wrote "[OpenSSL for iOS & Swift the Easy Way](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2015/09/21/openssl-for-ios-swift-the-easy-way/)" to guide you through this process if you need help.
3. You need to include the following additional resources after OpenSSL is installed. Example implementations are provided in the [demo project](https://github.com/andrewcbancroft/SwiftyLocalReceiptValidator/tree/master/Demo/SwiftyLocalReceiptValidatorDemo).
    * [pkcs7_union_accessors.c](https://github.com/andrewcbancroft/SwiftyLocalReceiptValidator/blob/master/Demo/SwiftyLocalReceiptValidatorDemo/pkcs7_union_accessors.c)
    * [pkcs7_union_accessors.h](https://github.com/andrewcbancroft/SwiftyLocalReceiptValidator/blob/master/Demo/SwiftyLocalReceiptValidatorDemo/pkcs7_union_accessors.h)

# Disclaimer
Preventing software piracy is hard. The code presented in this repository is not meant to protect you against unauthorized usage of your app or its features. This code is meant to be used for learning purposes only. If you use this code in your app, you do it at your own risk. 

You must take additional efforts to obfuscate the code presented here to thwart an attacker's attempt at circumventing the receipt validation logic contained within this repository.

# Usage
## Output Types
In order to make sense of the call site, I thought it might be helpful to include the *output* that you can expect from the `ReceiptValidator`:
```swift
enum ReceiptValidationResult {
	case success(ParsedReceipt)
	case error(ReceiptValidationError)
}

enum ReceiptValidationError : Error {
	case couldNotFindReceipt
	case emptyReceiptContents
	case receiptNotSigned
	case appleRootCertificateNotFound
	case receiptSignatureInvalid
	case malformedReceipt
	case malformedInAppPurchaseReceipt
	case incorrectHash
}

struct ParsedReceipt {
	let bundleIdentifier: String?
	let bundleIdData: NSData?
	let appVersion: String?
	let opaqueValue: NSData?
	let sha1Hash: NSData?
	let inAppPurchaseReceipts: [ParsedInAppPurchaseReceipt]?
	let originalAppVersion: String?
	let receiptCreationDate: Date?
	let expirationDate: Date?
}

struct ParsedInAppPurchaseReceipt {
	let quantity: Int?
	let productIdentifier: String?
	let transactionIdentifier: String?
	let originalTransactionIdentifier: String?
	let purchaseDate: Date?
	let originalPurchaseDate: Date?
	let subscriptionExpirationDate: Date?
	let cancellationDate: Date?
	let webOrderLineItemId: Int?
}
```
## Call Site
```swift
let receiptValidator = ReceiptValidator()
let validationResult = receiptValidator.validateReceipt()
		
switch validationResult {
case .success(let receipt):
  // Work with parsed receipt data. Possibilities might be...
    // enable a feature of your app
    // remove ads
    // etc...
case .error(let error):
  // Handle receipt validation failure. Possibilities might be...
    // use StoreKit to request a new receipt
    // enter a "grace period"
    // disable a feature of your app
    // etc...
}
```

# Explanatory Guides
Throughout the development of the code in this repository, I wrote up several guides at https://www.andrewcbancroft.com to explain what each step along the way in the receipt validation process is doing.

# Implementing In-app Purchases on iOS
Learning about in-app purchases on iOS?

I am the author of <a href="https://bit.ly/implementing-in-app-purchases-ios" class="alert-link">Implementing In-app Purchases on iOS</a> at <a href="http://bit.ly/ps-author-page" class="alert-link">Pluralsight</a>.  

In the course, you'll learn to offer digital products as in-app purchases from end to end:

‚ùáÔ∏è Configure products in App Store Connect & Xcode

‚ùáÔ∏è Build and test a fully-working Store view

‚ùáÔ∏è Protect your revenue by validating App Store receipts (I teach server-side validation in the course)

‚ùáÔ∏è Unlock content that users have legitimately purchased
